# WebServerProgramming
### Web Server Programming Project
###### started using java my freshman year of high school. I always knew I wanted to do something involving computers but I didn’t know it was programming I wanted to persue until I met my Computer programming teacher my freshman year. He was an amazing teacher that made me really excited to learn more everyday with great interactive projects and Indepth explanations. My major is Computer Science with a minor in music. I’ve taken CPS 1, 2, and 3, Object Oriented programming, machine learning, and Assembly language and Computer Architecture. I created a rythym game where a button would go down a line and you had to press the spacebar or click the mouse at the right time to get points. I did something similar except for instead of a button, it was a duck with a letter. You had to type the letter before the duck fell to the bottom of the screen. Getting faster and faster the longer you were able to go on. I plan to use the information learned from this class to create a personal portfolio website. I’d also like to be able to teach other students about web server programming in my club so that they can get experience creating a project for resumes and the learning experience. It will also push me to have a deeper understanding of I know so that I can effectively teach and explain to others.
